That includes 155 forests and 22 national grasslands. Breaking that down even further, the NFS maintains 403 wilderness areas and 23,000 developed recreation areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are some impressive numbers, but what it means for you and me are amazingly beautiful landscapes to explore, with cascading waterfalls, shimmering lakes and ponds, towering mountain ranges, and so much more. And best of all &mdash; it&rsquo;s all publicly owned. And you may not know this, but there is probably a national forest just down the road from you. In fact, 7 out of 10 Americans live within 100 miles of a national forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/joe-cuhaj-at-tuskegee-nationa26dcde-1024x768.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Joe Cuhaj at Tuskegee National Forest.&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/joe-cuhaj-at-tuskegee-nationa26dcde-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/joe-cuhaj-at-tuskegee-nationa26dcde-300x225.jpg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/joe-cuhaj-at-tuskegee-nationa26dcde-768x576.jpg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/joe-cuhaj-at-tuskegee-nationa26dcde-150x113.jpg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/joe-cuhaj-at-tuskegee-nationa26dcde.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOE CUHAJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a major difference between national parks and national forests. A national park protects and preserves unique places, such as historic and natural sites like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/2478942/hiking-grand-canyon/&quot;&gt;Grand Canyon National Park&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/semo/index.htm&quot;&gt;Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail&lt;/a&gt;. National forests, on the other hand, protect large tracts of lush wetlands, thick forests, waving grasslands, wilderness areas, and thousands of miles of rivers and streams all designated as being multiple use. Forest land is not only used for outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and camping, but also logging and cattle pasture grazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is there to experience in your national forests? Plenty!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Scenic Drives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What connects the public to the beauty and natural wonder of our national forests are their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/tourism/TourUS.pdf&quot;&gt;scenic byways&lt;/a&gt; and drives. These drives are the result of partnerships between the NFS, several other federal agencies, and many small communities across the country. They provide easy access to the nation&rsquo;s magnificent landscapes &mdash; its blazing fall foliage from overlooks like those along the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kancamagushighway.com/&quot;&gt;Kancamagus Scenic Byway&lt;/a&gt; in New Hampshire; drives through narrow rock tunnels in stony mountains on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelsouthdakota.com/trip-ideas/story/peter-norbeck-national-scenic-byway&quot;&gt;Norbeck Scenic Byway&lt;/a&gt; in South Dakota, or stops at an Amish roadside stand on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.go-ohio.com/Amish-Country-Byway/&quot;&gt;Amish Country Byway&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, there are 9,126 miles of roadway that make up 136 scenic byways, and that number is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/hiking-in-alabama-s-cheaha-wi83d866-1024x768.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hiking in Alabama\'s Cheaha Wilderness.&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/hiking-in-alabama-s-cheaha-wi83d866-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/hiking-in-alabama-s-cheaha-wi83d866-300x225.jpg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/hiking-in-alabama-s-cheaha-wi83d866-768x576.jpg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/hiking-in-alabama-s-cheaha-wi83d866-150x113.jpg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/hiking-in-alabama-s-cheaha-wi83d866.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOE CUHAJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. The Trails&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s your pleasure? Hiking? Biking? Horseback Riding? Today&rsquo;s national forests provide over 133,000 miles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/trails&quot;&gt;trails&lt;/a&gt; for everything from hiking to ATV riding to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/category/4305/activities-and-interests-outdoor-activities-snowshoeing/&quot;&gt;snowshoeing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national forest service oversees some of the country&rsquo;s most incredible recreational and scenic trails. Some of the more famous include the only sub-tropical trail in the country, the 1,300-mile-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.floridatrail.org/&quot;&gt;Florida Trail&lt;/a&gt;, the 2,600-mile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcta.org/&quot;&gt;Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail&lt;/a&gt; that stretches from Mexico to Canada on the U.S. west coast, and the granddaddy of them all, the 2,100-mile &lt;a href=&quot;https://appalachiantrail.org/&quot;&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When hiking, biking, horseback riding, or whatever your favorite trail-based activity, remember that most of the trails within a national forest are not blazed. Some are, but generally, they&rsquo;re not. That is to keep the forest as pristine and natural as possible. Always bring along a GPS or a map and compass to keep you on track. Cell phones are OK, but signal reception is dicey at best in most forests. Even if you are riding ATVs on forest service roads, they can be confusing, with a myriad of dirt roads that all look alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what brings you to a trail in one of our national forests, the rangers always need a helping hand. With so many trails, it&rsquo;s difficult to maintain them all. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/destinations&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; the NFS to find out how you can pitch in and help maintain these trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Wildlife Viewing And Birding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildlife viewing and bird watching are rated high on the list of why visitors come to a national forest. Pick a spot and sit quietly, and you are sure to see some incredible wildlife. In the Pisgah and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recarea/?recid=48634&quot;&gt;Nantahala National Forests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/2549271/stunning-hikes-in-north-carolina/&quot;&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, black bear roam free through the old-growth oak, hemlock, and tulip poplar forests. Moose saunter down the paths and peregrine falcons soar overhead in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/whitemountain&quot;&gt;White Mountain National Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/2480776/new-hampshire-hidden-gems/&quot;&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;. Mountain goats, river otters, and harbor seals are the norm at the spectacular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/tongass/&quot;&gt;Tongass National Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/2548495/The-Most-Stunning-Hikes-In-Alaska/&quot;&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, which has some of the wildest stretches of forest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When wildlife viewing in a forest, please follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/respect-wildlife/&quot;&gt;Leave No Trace&lt;/a&gt; principles: Keep your group small to avoid damaging the animal&rsquo;s habitat; do not chase, feed, or force animals to flee; and do not touch or pick up a wild animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, it&rsquo;s best to travel quietly through the forest, but in some cases, like in bear country, you should make a little noise to let them know you&rsquo;re there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/practicing-dispersal-camping3ba03f-1024x768.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Practicing dispersal camping, Conecuh National Forest.&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/practicing-dispersal-camping3ba03f-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/practicing-dispersal-camping3ba03f-300x225.jpg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/practicing-dispersal-camping3ba03f-768x576.jpg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/practicing-dispersal-camping3ba03f-150x113.jpg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/practicing-dispersal-camping3ba03f.jpg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOE CUHAJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Camping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/know-before-you-go/camping&quot;&gt;Camping&lt;/a&gt; is a pure joy at any one of our national forests. Whether it&rsquo;s tent, RV, or backcountry camping, you are sure to have a peaceful night&rsquo;s sleep under the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the national forest recreation areas have improved camping, where sites have water, electricity, picnic tables, and fire rings. If you&rsquo;re an RVer, there are also full-hookup sites. For tent campers, every site has a nice, level gravel pad where you can pitch your tent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sites can be reserved by selecting the national forest you will be visiting on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recreation.gov/&quot;&gt;Recreation.Gov&lt;/a&gt; website, which will also give you the latest fee schedule. But be sure to register early. They fill up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&rsquo;re a backpacker, you&rsquo;ll love hitting the trail and spending the night at a rock outcropping with a spectacular view, or near a lake or waterfall. Backcountry camping is allowed anywhere within the boundaries of a national forest but you must follow their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/fishlake/recreation/?cid=stelprdb5121831&quot;&gt;Dispersed Camping&lt;/a&gt; rules to avoid harming the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Dark Skies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than 100 years ago, you could walk out your back door, look up into the night sky, and be mesmerized by the brilliant shimmering stars in the night sky. Today, most people have never seen the Milky Way due to light pollution. The cure is to visit one of the national forests near you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many areas within a national forest that provide the perfect setting for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/nine-tips-to-enjoy-the-night-sky-on-national-forests&quot;&gt;stargazing&lt;/a&gt;, areas known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.darksky.org/&quot;&gt;Dark Sky Parks&lt;/a&gt; that give you an unobstructed view of the billions of stars and galaxies in the night sky, far from the light-polluted skies we have all become accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your best views, move away from the public campgrounds and head to the water. The banks of a pond or lake give you the best areas for getting lost in the stars. We all love to sit around a crackling fire at night when we camp, but douse the flames to get a flawless view. And better yet, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;NASA Night Sky Network&lt;/a&gt; to find a stargazing club and event near you, where fellow star watchers make your viewing more fun and informative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Paying Your Way: Fees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, entry into a national forest is free; however, you will have to pay a day-use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/passes-permits&quot;&gt;fee&lt;/a&gt; or camping fee if you visit one of the 40 developed recreation areas across the country. Fees vary from forest to forest, so before you go, find the national forest you will be visiting on the USDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/invalidurl&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to obtain that forest&rsquo;s fee schedule. And as mentioned earlier, you can find the latest camping fees and reserve a campsite online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recreation.gov/&quot;&gt;Recreation.Gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fees are waived on certain national holidays: Martin Luther King Jr. Day, President&rsquo;s Day, National Get Outdoors Day, National Public Lands Day, and Veterans Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/passes-permits&quot;&gt;Special permits&lt;/a&gt; are required for off-highway vehicle riding, rock climbing, shooting ranges, and cross-country ski trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Safety First&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple notes about exploring our national forests &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/safety/&quot;&gt;safely&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, cell phone signals can be elusive in wilderness areas. Always let someone know your plans before heading out &mdash; where you are heading, the route you will take, and the time they can expect you to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a trail register at a trailhead, sign, date it, and leave a note as to where you are going. That way rescuers will be able to find you in case of emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, hunting is allowed in our national forests. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fs.usda.gov/visit/destinations&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt; the forest&rsquo;s headquarters about dates, and wear hunter orange.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-06-20 10:47:43'),

Imagine the heart-pounding, dizzying effect of weightlessness in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is left to the imagination at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spaceportamerica.com/&quot;&gt;Spaceport America&lt;/a&gt; in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. Follow along with me and learn about how you can experience a launch, weightlessness, and other fantastic activities at America&rsquo;s first spaceport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Frontier Tours hosted my husband and me for our Spaceport America tour. However, all opinions are mine. Our work history in the space industry and manned space flight programs enriched our Spaceport America experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First: A Note On Virgin Galactic And Astronaut Sturckow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 22, 2021, &lt;a href=&quot;https://virgingalactic.com/&quot;&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt; successfully completed the first human spaceflight when they launched VSS&lt;i&gt; Unity&lt;/i&gt; from the mothership, VMS&lt;i&gt; Eve&lt;/i&gt;, in flight. VSS&lt;i&gt; Unity &lt;/i&gt;achieved Mach 3, reached space at an altitude of 55.45 miles, and then glided back to Earth on the same runway as the launch. CJ Sturckow, pilot-in-command, and Dave Mackay, controlled VSS&lt;i&gt; Unity&lt;/i&gt;, and Kelly Latimer and Michael Masucci piloted VMS&lt;i&gt; Eve&lt;/i&gt;. Sturckow is the first person ever to have flown to space from three different states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Richard Branson is the visionary behind Virgin Galactic. He and his team are responsible for this historic achievement, for helping to create the first commercial spaceport and claim the first human space flight from the spaceport. Branson intends to make space travel as accessible as airplane travel is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I learned of the recent successful flight, I remembered Neil Armstrong&rsquo;s statement when he landed on the moon. &ldquo;One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.&rdquo; This new flight milestone is a significant step forward for Virgin Galactic and human space flight in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Curtis-Rosemond-and-Spaceport-America-Tour-van-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Curtis-Rosemond-and-Spaceport-America-Tour-van-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Curtis-Rosemond-and-Spaceport-America-Tour-van-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Curtis-Rosemond-and-Spaceport-America-Tour-van-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Curtis-Rosemond-and-Spaceport-America-Tour-van-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Curtis-Rosemond-and-Spaceport-America-Tour-van-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;CURTIS ROSEMOND AND SPACEPORT AMERICA TOUR VAN (PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. How To Tour Spaceport America And Important Things To Know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first purpose-built commercial spaceport in the world, Spaceport America, is an FAA-licensed launch complex and active test facility. It is not open to public access, and launches aren&rsquo;t open to public viewing. Private tours are arranged online at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spaceportamerica.com/visit/&quot;&gt;Spaceport America website&lt;/a&gt; in advance through Final Frontier Tours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we visited the Southwest U.S., our tour with Final Frontier Tours began at the Visit Las Cruces Visitor Center. We boarded a 10-passenger van for the 57-mile drive to the Spaceport America facility and enjoyed the narration about the region.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, did you know that New Mexico is the leading producer of pecans in the U.S.? The Hatch Valley, famous for the unique terroir that contributes to the flavor and texture of the much sought-after Hatch chiles, is a scant 35 miles from Spaceport America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of our tour was that there were only 10 participants, which allowed a lot of interaction with our guide. We didn&rsquo;t feel rushed and herded, as often happens in a tour group. This tour was an authentic experience that you can&rsquo;t get anywhere else. Spaceport America is a real commercial space launch facility yet provides education with lots of hands-on and fun experiences. Curtis, our guide, was ever-present to photograph us in the best photo-op locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School programs are an essential experience at Spaceport America. They promote education with an emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). They want people to get excited about space and develop skills needed for space operations careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tips:&lt;/strong&gt; Tours start at the Spaceport America Visitor Center in downtown Truth or Consequences, at the Visit Las Cruces office in Las Cruces, or directly at the Spaceport America facility. Be sure to confirm the starting place for your tour. Also, know that Final Frontier Tours may cancel tours with fewer than seven passengers. Spaceport America may also cancel them due to launch activities at the facility. Tours are sold out several weeks in advance, so plan ahead for the date you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Approach-to-Space-Operations-Center-SOC-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Approach-to-Space-Operations-Center-SOC-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Approach-to-Space-Operations-Center-SOC-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Approach-to-Space-Operations-Center-SOC-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Approach-to-Space-Operations-Center-SOC-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Approach-to-Space-Operations-Center-SOC-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;APPROACH TO SPACE OPERATIONS CENTER (PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. The Gateway To Space&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/561423801&quot;&gt;slow approach&lt;/a&gt; to the Space Operations Center (SOC) seemed like an experience out of a fictional space movie. The vast open space enveloped an odd triple disk-like building. The suspense was almost palpable as the scene unfolded before us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From space, the facility looks like an alien landing signpost. Deserted roads with names like Asteroid Beltway are unmarked on maps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-hold-up-Genesis-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x768.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-hold-up-Genesis-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-hold-up-Genesis-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-hold-up-Genesis-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-hold-up-Genesis-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x113.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-hold-up-Genesis-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;GENESIS &ndash; SCULPTURE BY OTTO RIGAN (PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. In The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entrance to Spaceport America is marked with a giant sculpture named &lt;i&gt;Genesis&lt;/i&gt;, created by artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://ottoriganstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Otto Rigan.&lt;/a&gt; The 11,000-pound steel sculpture, inlaid with glass and mirror elements, was designed to represent the stars in the summer sky over the Spaceport.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Walk This Way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of features on the external walls of Astronaut Walk created curiosity for what was to come. Almost invisible doors provided access into the facility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Gateway-Gallery-and-GShock-trainer-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Gateway-Gallery-and-GShock-trainer-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Gateway-Gallery-and-GShock-trainer-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Gateway-Gallery-and-GShock-trainer-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Gateway-Gallery-and-GShock-trainer-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Gateway-Gallery-and-GShock-trainer-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;GATEWAY GALLERY AND GSHOCK TRAINER (PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Gateway Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateway Gallery is filled with light, space, art, and the GShock Trainer. I wanted to run to every display kiosk and study the mural like a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Journey Upward&lt;/i&gt; mural is a timeline from prehistoric time to the current day and beyond. Short interpretative descriptions of the region&rsquo;s history and culture are depicted in the mural and found on four different touch screens in the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-show-they-have-the-right-stuff-2-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-show-they-have-the-right-stuff-2-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-show-they-have-the-right-stuff-2-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-show-they-have-the-right-stuff-2-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-show-they-have-the-right-stuff-2-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Guests-show-they-have-the-right-stuff-2-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. GShock Trainer And The Right Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elaborate centerpiece in the Gateway Gallery is the Multi-axis trainer (MAT), otherwise known as the GShock (G is for gravitational) Centrifugal Trainer. The trainer is a gimbal rig with yaw, roll, and pitch that simulates the extreme forces astronauts face during launch, maneuvers, and re-entry. The astronauts experience disorientation to space upon re-entry when in a tumble spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several hardy souls on our tour showed that they had the right stuff and took a spin on the MAT. I was not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Space Operations Center (SOC)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mission Control Room is the heart of space flight operations. Flight controllers and other ground personnel, the problem-solving team, manage flights from before liftoff through landing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s easy to imagine launch day preparations when we touched the desktop, computers, dials, and microphone. Sitting in the decision-making seat was awe-inspiring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Tour-guest-at-Mission-Control-Desk-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Tour-guest-at-Mission-Control-Desk-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Tour-guest-at-Mission-Control-Desk-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Tour-guest-at-Mission-Control-Desk-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Tour-guest-at-Mission-Control-Desk-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Tour-guest-at-Mission-Control-Desk-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;AUTHOR&rsquo;S HUSBAND, MISSION CONTROL DESK (PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband supported many Shuttle missions at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and Houston. Notice the fond look on his face for this fantastic experience at Spaceport America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Firefighting On The Ground&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-depth &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/561422714&quot;&gt;demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; by the lead firefighter delivered a close-up and unique experience to his audience. From extremely loud alarms on oxygen tanks to real-weight, dead-weight dummies, we gained a deep understanding of the perils and responsibilities during a fire emergency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrilled to climb up into the cab of the behemoth fire engine, I gazed in wonder around the interior. Like a spaceship, the dashboard had a dizzying number of gauges, levers, and signals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Fire-crew-teaching-guests-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Fire-crew-teaching-guests-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Fire-crew-teaching-guests-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Fire-crew-teaching-guests-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Fire-crew-teaching-guests-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Fire-crew-teaching-guests-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another feature of this fantastic fire department tour included donning the heavy and cumbersome firefighter&rsquo;s uniform &mdash; boots, jacket, and helmet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Enormous Assembly Room&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive room where the space vehicle assembly takes place was empty during our visit. A large observation window into the cavernous space helped us visualize the magnitude and size of the flight vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Space-Operations-Center-front-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Space-Operations-Center-front-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Space-Operations-Center-front-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Space-Operations-Center-front-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Space-Operations-Center-front-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Space-Operations-Center-front-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;702&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPACE OPERATIONS CENTER (PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Cruising Altitude And Runway Launch Simulation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the tour van limited our cruising altitude to Mother Earth, access to almost every corner of Spaceport America made us aware of the remoteness of the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitting end to our fantastic Spaceport America experiences, Curtis revved up the van&rsquo;s engine, approached the threshold, lined the vehicle upon the centerline of the 12,000-by-200-foot wide runway, and released the brake. I thought for sure we were going to take flight as that line rapidly disappeared under the speeding vehicle. Alas, we remained earthbound while our imaginations soared into space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Virgin-Galactic-exhibit-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; srcset=&quot;https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Virgin-Galactic-exhibit-Julie-Diebolt-Price-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Virgin-Galactic-exhibit-Julie-Diebolt-Price-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Virgin-Galactic-exhibit-Julie-Diebolt-Price-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Virgin-Galactic-exhibit-Julie-Diebolt-Price-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/06/Virgin-Galactic-exhibit-Julie-Diebolt-Price.jpeg 1200w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;VIRGIN GALACTIC EXHIBIT (PHOTO CREDIT: JULIE DIEBOLT PRICE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11.

The state enjoys a robust economy and takes advantage of the scientific potential of the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spaceport America is 18,000 acres adjacent to the U.S. Army&rsquo;s White Sands Missile Range in Southern New Mexico, including a 6,000 square mile no-fly airspace. That is, from surface to unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many lodging choices in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Well-known chain hotels, boutique hotels, and house rentals offer good options. Make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/2495440/las-cruces-new-mexico-things-to-do/&quot;&gt;Las Cruces&lt;/a&gt; your base as a central point between Truth or Consequences, Hatch, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/2494377/sand-dunes-in-southwest/&quot;&gt;White Sands National Park.&lt;/a&gt;When you are in the area, plan a trip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelawaits.com/category/activities-and-interests/national-parks/united-states-national-parks/white-sands/&quot;&gt;White Sands National Park&lt;/a&gt;. It&rsquo;s like no place else on Earth. Gypsum sand in wave-like dunes consumed 275 square miles of desert. Ranger programs at the park include Sunset Strolls presented every night and Full Moon guided hikes offered many times during the year. It&rsquo;s only 52 miles from Las Cruces and a fantastic experience.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-06-20 11:06:42');

Don&rsquo;t sweat the stuff you can&rsquo;t control. Life is much too short to be angry &amp;amp; annoyed all the time while traveling. Did you miss your bus? No worries, there will be another one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATM out of money? Great! Take an unplanned road trip over to the next town and explore. I know it can be hard sometimes, but &lt;strong&gt;just take a deep breath and remind yourself that it could be worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2: Wake Up Early To Avoid Crowds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rise before sunrise to have the best attractions all to yourself while avoiding large tourist crowds. It&rsquo;s also a magical time for photos due to soft diffused light, and it&rsquo;s usually easier to interact with locals getting ready for their day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want those postcard &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/instagram-travel/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram travel shots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? You need to get out there before everyone else shows up. Sketchy areas are less dangerous in the morning too. Honest hardworking people wake up early; scammers and criminals sleep in&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3: Observe Daily Life Around You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get a feel for the pulse of a place, one of my favorite travel tips is to spend a few hours sitting in a park or on a busy street corner by yourself just watching day to day life happen in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow down your train of thought and pay close attention to the details around you. The smells, the colors, human interactions, and sounds. It&rsquo;s a kind of meditation &mdash; and you&rsquo;ll see stuff you never noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;READ MORE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/best-travel-quotes/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Favorite Quotes About Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more-900x600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travel Tips to Have a Good Trip&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more-900x600.jpg 900w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more-400x267.jpg 400w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more-333x222.jpg 333w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more-800x533.jpg 800w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-laugh-more.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relax, and Enjoy Yourself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4: Laugh At Yourself Sometimes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/skydiving-fiji/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;definitely look like a fool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; many times when traveling to new places. Rather than get embarrassed, laugh at yourself. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to screw up, and don&rsquo;t take life so seriously. Relax!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One time a whole bus full of Guatemalans laughed with glee when I forced the bus driver to stop so I could urgently pee on the side of the road. Returning to the bus and laughing with them gave me new friends for the rest of the journey!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mediavine-res.cloudinary.com/v1617569534/qaoyshib2pdzhrkcqovs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Subscribe for updates from this site&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5: Slow Down To Enjoy Your Trip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please don&rsquo;t try to cram 6 countries into 6 weeks of travel. All the good stuff happens when you really take the time to explore. You&rsquo;ll learn about activities that aren&rsquo;t in your guidebook and meet people who are eager to show you around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can honestly say that NONE of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/best/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best travel experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; happened within the first few days of arriving somewhere. Spend more time in fewer places for maximum enjoyment. I promise you&rsquo;ll have a much better time!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with that, I highly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/renting-a-car-in-europe/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;renting a car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when you travel to foreign countries. Sure, it can be a bit scary to drive somewhere new, but it really opens up your opportunities for adventure! Plus its a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6: Volunteer Occasionally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it a point to &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/build-poop-oven/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;volunteer some of your time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for worthwhile projects when traveling. Not only is it a very rewarding experience, but you&rsquo;ll often learn more about the country and its people while also making new friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s a great site called &lt;a href=&quot;http://grassrootsvolunteering.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grassroots Volunteering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you can search for highly recommended volunteer opportunities around the world. Just be very careful with voluntourism and do your research, as there are many scams out there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;READ MORE: &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/best-travel-quotes/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40 Travel Jobs To Work Overseas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography-900x600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travel Photography Tips&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography-900x600.jpg 900w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography-400x267.jpg 400w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography-333x222.jpg 333w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography-800x534.jpg 800w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/travel-tips-photography.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel Tip: Take Lots of Photos!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7: Take Lots Of Epic Travel Photos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to this travel tip. You may only see these places &amp;amp; meet these people once in your lifetime. Remember them forever with plenty of photos! Don&rsquo;t worry about looking like a &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;. Great photos are the ultimate souvenirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/antarctica-pictures/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Penguin Escapes Killer Whales!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don&rsquo;t cost anything, they&rsquo;re easy to share, and they don&rsquo;t take up space in your luggage. Take plenty of photos of yourself with other people too, they&rsquo;ll be more important than your postcard shots later. Just remember that once you get your shot, it&rsquo;s important to get out from behind the lens and actually enjoy the view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/photography-classes-thumbnail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Best Photography Online Classes&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Better Travel Photos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is impossible. If you are having trouble going somewhere or doing something, don&rsquo;t give up. You just haven&rsquo;t found the best solution or met the right person yet. Don&rsquo;t listen to those who say it can&rsquo;t be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perseverance pays off. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been told what I want to do isn&rsquo;t possible, only to prove it wrong later when I don&rsquo;t listen and try anyway. What&rsquo;s the worst that can happen? Failing isn&rsquo;t the end of the world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9: Break Out Of Your Comfort Zone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenge yourself to &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/sak-yant-tattoo/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;try things that normally give you anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The more you do this, the more that anxiety will fade away. Not a hiker? Go on more hikes. Have trouble talking to strangers? Talk to everyone. Scared of weird food? Eat the weirdest thing you can find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason this works so well while traveling is because everything is already so different, what&rsquo;s one more new/uncomfortable experience? No one knows who you are out here, you can totally reinvent yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips-900x600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;International Travel Tips for your Journey&quot; srcset=&quot;https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips-900x600.jpg 900w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips-400x267.jpg 400w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips-333x222.jpg 333w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips-800x534.jpg 800w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/source/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips-600x400.jpg 600w, https://cdn-aokhp.nitrocdn.com/jKFJbmjLyzwpPtWKXrjTqmeJOWXIlQZX/assets/static/optimized/rev-dd0543a/wp-content/uploads/international-travel-tips.jpg 1280w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel Tip: Keep an Open Mind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10: Keep An Open Mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&rsquo;t judge the lifestyles or customs of others if &lt;a href=&quot;https://expertvagabond.com/afghanistan-photos-wakhan/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;different from your own&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to opinions you don&rsquo;t agree with. It&rsquo;s arrogant to assume your views are correct and other people are wrong. Practice empathy and put yourself in someone else&rsquo;s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embrace different possibilities, opinions, religions, customs, and interests. Ask questions. You don&rsquo;t have to agree with everyone, but you may be surprised what you&rsquo;ll learn from the people you meet during your travels.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-06-20 11:31:12'),

Its entire chain will see about 90% of the business it saw in 2019 during the two-week period around July 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of that has been focused around resorts, which Hoplamazian said &ldquo;are back with a vengeance.&rdquo; Hyatt&rsquo;s resorts are about 30% above where they were in 2019 over that same holiday period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four in ten Americas say they intend to take a vacation that would involve a flight or a hotel booking between Memorial Day and the end of September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/transportation/summer-travel-plans-survey-2021.html&quot;&gt;according to a survey from Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;.

We generally recommend choosing a mid-range hotel because they offer the best value for money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our personal top hotel recommendation for New York&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our favorite hotel in New York is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/citizenm-new-york-times-square-new-york.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;citizenM Hotel&lt;/a&gt; just off of Times Square, which offers excellent value for money in a perfect location. We had already stayed at a citizenM in Rotterdam before and were really impressed with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each hotel only has a single room category, and all the rooms have the same layout with super-modern furnishings. We&rsquo;re total fans of citizenM and would recommend the hotel to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new CitizenM recently opened in the Bowery. If you&rsquo;ve been to New York before and don&rsquo;t want to stay around Times Square, then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/citizenm-new-york-bowery.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;citizenM in Bowery&lt;/a&gt; is a great alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/citizenm-new-york.webp&quot; alt=&quot;citizenM New York&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/citizenm-new-york.webp 1050w, https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/citizenm-new-york-700x467.webp 700w, https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/citizenm-new-york-350x233.webp 350w, https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/citizenm-new-york-175x117.webp 175w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our room at the citizenM Times Square in New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;For first-timers: Midtown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Midtown is the right place to stay for you&lt;/strong&gt; if this is your first time in New York, you want to see a lot of sights in the shortest time possible, and you want to avoid long travel times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of town is perfect for about 90% of New York visitors.&amp;nbsp;Midtown isn&rsquo;t just the most popular district for hotel searches, it&rsquo;s also the area with the largest selection of hotels in every price range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&rsquo;ll be staying within walking distance of many of the most important and most famous sights: 5th Avenue, Times Square, the Broadway theaters, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Rockefeller Center, Central Park, and the Empire State Building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Midtown you can easily explore the city on foot and it&rsquo;s perfectly connected to all the other parts of the town. All the major subway lines run through Midtown, so it&rsquo;s really easy to get to any other station in the city. In other words: perfect!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of staying in Midtown:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super-central&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Super-well connected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Huge selection of hotels in every price range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of sights within walking distance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of staying in Midtown:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An area for tourists, not for locals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fewer cool restaurants than in other districts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A never-ending throng of tourists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Noise (check the hotel reviews to find a quiet hotel)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our personal hotel recommendations for the Midtown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where to stay in Midtown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good and cheap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/pod.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;Pod 51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/citizenm-new-york-times-square-new-york.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;citizenM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our tip!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-refinery.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;The Refinery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;For luxury lovers Upper East Side&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Upper East Side is the right area to stay for you&lt;/strong&gt; if you like things a little quieter, you want to go for a run in Central Park in the morning, and you plan to explore the museums of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Upper East Side has changed a bit over the years, people still think of it as the neighborhood of the rich and beautiful, with expensive clothes and tiny dogs in handbags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course that&rsquo;s a bit of a stereotype, but there&rsquo;s more than a kernel of truth to it.&amp;nbsp;In spite of that, or perhaps because of it, it&rsquo;s worth staying in the Upper East Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s full of beautiful buildings and luxury boutiques, with Central Park as a scenic backdrop. 5th Avenue, which runs east of Central Park, is home to the city&rsquo;s most famous museums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of 5th Avenue is also known as Museum Mile. There you&rsquo;ll find the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum, the Goethe Institute, and the Neue Galerie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of staying in the Upper East Side:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Within walking distance of many of the city&rsquo;s major museums&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Central Park is right next door&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quieter than the other districts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of staying in the Upper East Side:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hotels are a bit more expensive than in the other districts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smaller selection of restaurants and bars, especially in the lower price ranges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slightly longer journey to the sights in the south of Manhattan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where to stay on the Upper East Side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/wales.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;Hotel Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/affinia-gardens.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;Gardens Suites Hotel by Affinia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All hotels in the Upper East Side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-us.html?aid=1287036&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;sid=fd054cdc1b7c8bf3e0134d0e03ca6afc&amp;amp;sb=1&amp;amp;sb_lp=1&amp;amp;src=index&amp;amp;src_elem=sb&amp;amp;error_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Findex.en-us.html%3Faid%3D1287036%3Bsid%3Dfd054cdc1b7c8bf3e0134d0e03ca6afc%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%26%3B&amp;amp;sr_autoscroll=1&amp;amp;ss=New+York&amp;amp;is_ski_area=0&amp;amp;checkin_year=&amp;amp;checkin_month=&amp;amp;checkout_year=&amp;amp;checkout_month=&amp;amp;group_adults=2&amp;amp;group_children=0&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&amp;amp;b_h4u_keep_filters=&amp;amp;from_sf=1&quot;&gt;To all hotels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;For romantics: Chelsea &amp;amp; Greenwich Village&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chelsea and Greenwich Village are the right places to stay for you&lt;/strong&gt; if you&rsquo;ve been to New York before, have already checked out the main sights, and now want to immerse yourself deeper into New York life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they&rsquo;re also great as an alternative if you don&rsquo;t want to stay in tourist areas, but would rather experience an authentic slice of New York life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenwich Village is the art district and, just like Chelsea, it&rsquo;s teeming with life.&amp;nbsp;You can spend hours on Washington Square just listening to street musicians and watching passers-by without ever getting bored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or you can take a stroll through narrow, winding streets and admire New York&rsquo;s typical sandstone buildings, or enjoy a meal at one of the many cute little restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenwich Village also has some excellent comedy clubs, and you should visit at least one of them. If you&rsquo;re into jazz bars, then the Village is a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like swanky clubs, you&rsquo;ll find several of those in the Meatpacking District, which also belongs to this part of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of staying in Chelsea &amp;amp; Greenwich Village:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An authentic New York experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A large selection of great restaurants in every price range&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A wide range of very stylish hotels at reasonable prices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The major sights in the south (Wall Street, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty) are only a short subway ride away&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of staying in Chelsea &amp;amp; Greenwich Village:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The sights in Midtown aren&rsquo;t within walking distance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It can get a bit loud here in the evening and at night (make sure to check the hotel reviews for noise complaints)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where to stay in Chelsea &amp;amp; Greenwich Village&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good and cheap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-janenyc.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;The Jane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/arlo-soho.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;Arlo SoHo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/east-houston.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;The Ridge Hotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All hotels in Chelsea &amp;amp; Greenwich Village&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-us.html?aid=1287036&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;ss=Chelsea%2C+New+York%2C+New+York+State%2C+USA&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&quot;&gt;To all hotels in Chelsea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-us.html?aid=1287036&amp;amp;lang=en-us&amp;amp;sid=fd054cdc1b7c8bf3e0134d0e03ca6afc&amp;amp;sb=1&amp;amp;sb_lp=1&amp;amp;src=index&amp;amp;src_elem=sb&amp;amp;error_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Findex.en-us.html%3Faid%3D1287036%3Bsid%3Dfd054cdc1b7c8bf3e0134d0e03ca6afc%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%26%3B&amp;amp;sr_autoscroll=1&amp;amp;ss=Greenwich+Village%2C+New+York%2C+New+York+State%2C+USA&amp;amp;is_ski_area=&amp;amp;checkin_year=&amp;amp;checkin_month=&amp;amp;checkout_year=&amp;amp;checkout_month=&amp;amp;group_adults=1&amp;amp;group_children=0&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&amp;amp;b_h4u_keep_filters=&amp;amp;from_sf=1&amp;amp;ss_raw=greenwi&amp;amp;ac_position=1&amp;amp;ac_langcode=en&amp;amp;ac_click_type=b&amp;amp;dest_id=980&amp;amp;dest_type=district&amp;amp;place_id_lat=40.7332868503741&amp;amp;place_id_lon=-74.0017572059485&amp;amp;search_pageview_id=17f57d245fb5000e&amp;amp;search_selected=true&amp;amp;search_pageview_id=17f57d245fb5000e&amp;amp;ac_suggestion_list_length=5&amp;amp;ac_suggestion_theme_list_length=0&quot;&gt;To all hotels in Greenwich Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show you our very own list of &lt;strong&gt;what to pack for Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;.

Both districts are achingly hip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soho borders Greenwich Village to the south and is best-known for its beautiful cast-iron buildings and its many art and design shops. Just like Soho, the Lower East Side is a typical New York residential neighborhood. So you won&rsquo;t find any super-famous sights here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what both neighborhoods have to offer instead is an incredibly diverse street scene, and a mix of super-trendy restaurants and boutiques in all price ranges. The best thing about the neighborhoods is that you can get to many other parts of the city on foot from here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere else in New York do you get so swept up in life on the streets. Little Italy, the Bowery, Chinatown &ndash; everything&rsquo;s just a stone&rsquo;s throw away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of staying in Soho &amp;amp; the East Village:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You&rsquo;ll be staying where New Yorkers live&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are plenty of restaurants, bars, and stores for every budget&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of staying in Soho &amp;amp; the East Village:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The East Village in particular isn&rsquo;t that well connected&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have to take public transport to all the important sights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where to stay in Soho &amp;amp; on the Lower East Side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good and cheap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/east-houston.en-us.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;The Ridge Hotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/sohotel-new-york-new-york.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;Sohotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/nolitan.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;Nolitan Hotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All hotels in Soho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-us.html?aid=1287036;sid=fd054cdc1b7c8bf3e0134d0e03ca6afc;class_interval=1&amp;amp;dest_id=965&amp;amp;dest_type=district&amp;amp;district=965&amp;amp;dtdisc=0&amp;amp;group_adults=1&amp;amp;group_children=0&amp;amp;inac=0&amp;amp;index_postcard=0&amp;amp;keep_landing=1&amp;amp;label_click=undef&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;postcard=0&amp;amp;room1=A&amp;amp;sb_price_type=total&amp;amp;shw_aparth=1&amp;amp;slp_r_match=0&amp;amp;ss_all=0&amp;amp;ssb=empty&amp;amp;sshis=0&amp;amp;top_ufis=1&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;To all hotels in Soho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-us.html?aid=1287036;sid=fd054cdc1b7c8bf3e0134d0e03ca6afc;class_interval=1&amp;amp;dest_id=965&amp;amp;dest_type=district&amp;amp;district=965&amp;amp;dtdisc=0&amp;amp;group_adults=1&amp;amp;group_children=0&amp;amp;inac=0&amp;amp;index_postcard=0&amp;amp;keep_landing=1&amp;amp;label_click=undef&amp;amp;no_rooms=1&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;postcard=0&amp;amp;room1=A&amp;amp;sb_price_type=total&amp;amp;shw_aparth=1&amp;amp;slp_r_match=0&amp;amp;ss_all=0&amp;amp;ssb=empty&amp;amp;sshis=0&amp;amp;top_ufis=1&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;To all hotels in the Lower East Side&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cheap accommodation in Queens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queens is the right district to stay for you&lt;/strong&gt; if you&rsquo;re looking for cheap accommodation in New York. You&rsquo;ll get a lot more value for your money and won&rsquo;t have to spend upwards of 200 euros for your room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;ve deliberately chosen Queens as our sole recommended district outside of Manhattan because it&rsquo;s just a short ride from there to Midtown by subway (about 15 minutes). And it has some really nice hotels at a fair price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don&rsquo;t mind taking the subway from Queens to Manhattan every day and you want more for bang for your buck, then Queens is the right place for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of staying in Queens:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better value for money than in Manhattan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheaper, but still fairly close to the most important sights&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Queens offers a beautiful panoramic view of the New York skyline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of staying in Queens:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Located outside of Manhattan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You always have to take the subway to go sightseeing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our personal hotel recommendations for Queens:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where to stay in Queens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good and cheap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-local-hostel-nyc.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;The Local Hostel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/paper-factory.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;Paper Factory Hotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/us/the-boro-hotel-lic.en.html?aid=1287036&quot;&gt;The Boro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make sure to book a room with a view of Manhattan!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-york-blog.webp&quot; alt=&quot;New York hotel tips&quot; srcset=&quot;https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-york-blog.webp 1050w, https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-york-blog-700x467.webp 700w, https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-york-blog-350x233.webp 350w, https://www.22places.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/new-york-blog-175x117.webp 175w&quot; sizes=&quot;100vw&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right hotel, in the right part of New York, will make your stay that much more special! And our hotel tips will help you find it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cheap accommodation in New Jersey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey is another state, but is located right across from Manhattan on the other side of the Hudson River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jersey City is right across from Manhattan and especially the hotels right at the water habe a beautiful view of the Manhattan Skyline. However, the hotel prices are not cheaper than in Manhattan, simply because you can get there pretty fast by subway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to save money, you should look at the hotels in Newark. They don&rsquo;t offer a view on Manhattan, since Newark is located a little further outside, but a good room costs between 100 and 150 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should definitely book a hotel close to the Newark Penn Station.

We&rsquo;d still advise against staying in an Airbnb apartment in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&rsquo;s why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbnb ruins the housing market for locals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used to be huge fans of Airbnb. For two reasons: It allows you to rent out your apartment when you&rsquo;re on vacation, and you get to stay at a private apartment instead of a hotel and feel at home everywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic concept is great. But these days, Airbnb is full of professional vacation rentals leased for the sole purpose of putting them on Airbnb and filled with random ugly furniture to make a quick buck by renting them out 365 days a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: The housing market in major cities has become even more overcrowded and prices have skyrocketed. People are being driven out of popular districts, which then devolve into total tourist traps. That really sucks and we don&rsquo;t want to contribute to this cycle any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&rsquo;ve had several bad experiences with Airbnb.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;ve had some very bad experiences with Airbnb apartments over the past few years and were very disappointed with their customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ended up emailing back and forth with Airbnb&rsquo;s customer service for several days, sometimes even weeks, only to come to the realization that guests ultimately get the short end of the stick when problems arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Airbnb has been illegal in New York since October 2016 (with some exceptions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York has never been a place for affordable housing. So it didn&rsquo;t help that the city was full of apartments with the sole purpose of being rented out on Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to give you a rough idea of the rent situation on the New York housing market: A small room in a shared apartment (a window is a luxury!) with a private bathroom in Manhattan starts at 1,700 dollars and can cost as much as 3,500 dollars!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder then that New Yorkers spend an average of 60 percent of their income on rent. Airbnb exacerbated the situation in recent years, and so stricter regulations were put in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the new laws, renting out apartments for short periods of time (less than a month) is illegal &ndash; regardless of whether it&rsquo;s a private apartment that&rsquo;s only rented out from time to time, or an apartment that&rsquo;s essentially a full-time vacation home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only exception: Up to two people can stay at an apartment with a New York resident if you share the apartment with them. The introduction of these strict guidelines was also accompanied by a major crackdown on illegal rentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first it targeted providers who rented out several apartments on Airbnb, but in the past months it&rsquo;s also been extended to private landlords, incurring severe penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, now we&rsquo;ll get off our soapbox &ndash; we just think it&rsquo;s important to give you a little context about New York and Airbnb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;ve consciously decided against staying at Airbnb apartments because we&rsquo;ve experienced the issues that arise from a crowded housing market first-hand in our adopted home of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.22places.com/where-to-stay-in-berlin/&quot;&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-06-20 10:55:04'),

The distinctive Renaissance revival building, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, whose accolades include The Plaza in New York, boasts the most opulent lobby in the city, ornate with gilded ceilings and trompe l&rsquo;&oelig;il paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Porches Inn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.theculturetrip.com/768x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/the-porches-inn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Porches Inn&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtesy of Porches Inn / Expedia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porches Inn is a unique converted row of late 19th-century houses just a stone&rsquo;s throw from one of America&rsquo;s largest contemporary art museums, the MASS MoCA. The chic guest rooms feature color-block decor enlivened by injections of retro design. Naturally, being but a stone&rsquo;s throw from the visionary gallery, Porches has collaborated with MASS MoCA to establish an artist-in-residence program, and features installations by Nina Katchadourian (2008) and Mike Glier (2004) on the premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;XV Beacon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.theculturetrip.com/768x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/47fde46f-jpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fifteen Beacon, Boston&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtesy of XV Beacon / Expedia.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renowned interior designer Celeste Cooper has coordinated a triumphant fusion of antique and contemporary style in this restored 1903 Beaux Arts building. The rooms at XV Beacon, with high ceilings and neutral tones, are enlivened by technological touches and controlled splashes of color and abstract art. Commissioned paintings by modern artists hang next to original cage elevators and ancient historical artefacts, including a 4th-century Roman mosaic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;76 Main&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutique Hotel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.theculturetrip.com/768x/smart/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/76-main-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;76 Main 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtesy of 76 Main Nantucket / Expedia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In historical Nantucket, the 76 Main hotel is an exposition of contemporary interior design, curated by Boston-based Rachel Reider. There is not an outdated doily in sight in this 1800s Federalist&rsquo;s house; the charmingly tailored rooms are packed with modern furnishings, plush fabrics and sophisticated amenities. The breezy blue and white scheme, reflecting &lt;a href=&quot;http://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/massachusetts/articles/where-to-eat-in-nantucket-top-10-local-restaurants-/&quot;&gt;Nantucket&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo;s nautical character, is kept fresh by eclectic accents and funky custom-made upholstery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Charlotte Inn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Charlotte Inn revives old-world hospitality in the Edgartown Edwardian-era home of Samuel Osborne Jr, one of the last successful whaling ship owners. From the mahogany Scottish barrister&rsquo;s check-in desk to the hand-carved four-poster beds, authentic antiques, objects d&rsquo;art and fine 19th-century oil paintings, period features are abundant throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Deerfield Inn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bed and Breakfast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deerfield Inn is situated in the rural heart of Massachusetts, in a National Historic Landmark-listed village. The Inn has been welcoming visitors to its 24 guest rooms, and into its farm-to-fork restaurant and tavern since 1884. Embracing wing chairs by the fireplace, white rockers and bright Adirondack chairs on the lawn, the handsome Deerfield Inn reflects traditional New England rural comfort.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-06-20 11:54:12');
